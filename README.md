Introducing VOCA – Your Voice. Your Assistant. Supercharged by AI. 🎉🚨

After weeks of designing, coding, and testing with the cutting-edge power of AI, I'm thrilled to unveil VOCA — a futuristic AI Voice Assistant App, built using Flutter and powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash. 🧠📱



🎙️ What is VOCA?
VOCA is an intelligent voice assistant that doesn’t just respond — it understands, speaks, and creates.

✨ Key Features:

🔹 Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration – Fast, smart, and capable of handling multi-language prompts with impressive reasoning.
🔹 Auto Prompt Classifier – Determines whether a prompt should return text or trigger AI image generation, thanks to Gemini Flash Preview Image Model.
🔹 Text-to-Speech (flutter_tts) – Responses are voiced naturally, making the assistant feel human.
🔹 Speech-to-Text (speech_to_text) – Speak directly to VOCA — and it listens.
🔹 Flutter UI – Sleek, responsive design with real-time interaction, floating mic, chat bubbles, and assistant feedback.
