 🗣️ VOCA – Voice Powered AI Assistant

**Voca** is a multilingual voice assistant app built with Flutter, powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for AI responses and **Imagen 4.0** for stunning image generation. It supports voice-to-text and text-to-speech interactions, allowing users to talk to an AI that can respond with both spoken answers and AI-generated images!
